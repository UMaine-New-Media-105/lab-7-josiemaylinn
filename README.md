During today's lab, we experimented using loops and arrays to create different patterns within the canvas.

For the first challenge, I was able to use a single loop to create a diagonal line of small circles, using an array to assign random colors to each of them.

For the second challenge, I was able to use nested loops to create an 8x8 grid of squares contaning a gradient that goes from red to pink.
